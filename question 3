Question 3. Define accessibility in the context of web development? Discuss why it's essential to create accessible
            websites and how it benefits different user groups

ans:-       Accessibility in the context of web development refers to the design and implementation of websites and web applications in a way that makes them usable and understandable 
            by people with a diverse range of abilities and disabilities. The goal of web accessibility is to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities, 
            can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the content and functionality of a website

            Creating accessible websites is essential for several reasons:

            Inclusivity: Web accessibility ensures that everyone, including people with disabilities, can access and use online resources. It promotes inclusivity and 
                         helps prevent the exclusion of individuals based on their abilities.

            Legal and Ethical Compliance: Many countries have laws and regulations that require websites to be accessible. Ensuring accessibility is not only a legal requirement in 
                                          some cases but also an ethical responsibility to provide equal access to information and services.

            Expanded Audience: By making websites accessible, developers can reach a broader audience. This includes individuals with disabilities, but also older adults, people with temporary 
                               impairments (such as a broken arm), and those using a wide range of devices (including mobile devices and screen readers).

            Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Many accessibility practices, such as providing descriptive alt text for images, also contribute to improved SEO. This can lead to better search engine 
                                              rankings and increased visibility for websites.

            User Experience (UX): Accessible websites often result in better overall user experience for all users. Clear navigation, well-organized content, and 
                                  adaptable design benefit everyone, not just those with disabilities.

            In summary, web accessibility is crucial for creating an inclusive online environment, complying with legal requirements, expanding the user base, 
            improving SEO, and enhancing the overall user experience for all visitors. By prioritizing accessibility in web development, developers contribute to a 
            more equitable and user-friendly digital landscape.
